# currency-exchanger

This project is a currency exchanger inspired by one of the first problems on the website Exercism, in their Python track.

The goal of this project was to utilize python to create a program that could give up to date conversions between the US dollar 
and select other currencies. 

This program uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Request, and tKinter to get the data, reorganize it into a usable form, and present it in a GUI.
